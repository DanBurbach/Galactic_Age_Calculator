# Galactic Age Calculator

#### Calculates a users age based off of what planet they are on.

#### By Daniel Burbach

## Description

This program takes a numeric input of the age of a user. This returns the age they are on each planet in our solar system. Given the users entered demograph, it will also return the number of years left to "live" that they might have.
